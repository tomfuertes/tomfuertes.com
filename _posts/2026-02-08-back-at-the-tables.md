Before software I played poker for a living. Online No Limit Hold'em, 6-12 tables at once, HUD tracking everyone's stats in real time. A live player sees maybe 30 hands an hour but multi-tabling online you'd see 600+, so you'd compress a year of experience into a month. The edge wasn't talent - it was volume. More reps meant faster instincts.

Then [UIGEA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unlawful_Internet_Gambling_Enforcement_Act_of_2006) killed online poker in the US, so I traveled to play live for about three years. I quit after getting robbed at gunpoint, which has a way of clarifying your career priorities. Moved into engineering and that was that.

The current AI tooling stack reminds me of those online sessions. Claude in the terminal, agents running parallel workstreams, MCP wiring context everywhere, voice prompting so you stay in the "what should this do" headspace instead of fighting docs - every hour just covers more ground than it used to. Not "write code faster" the way autocomplete was, but a structural change in how you work.

I've been writing software for over a decade, and most of it had settled into a rhythm where nothing surprised me anymore. This broke that. I'm [shipping side projects again](/2026/02/06/murmur-and-vandl-playing-with-claude-agents.html) because the tools compressed the tedious middle part down to minutes. It's been a while since anything in tech made me want to put in more hours, not fewer.
