It's been 12 years since I've written here, but it felt like time to dust this thing off.

## The Origin of Goose Farmer

If you've checked my LinkedIn, you've noticed it says "Goose Farmer." This comes from [Feng Yuan](https://80.lv/articles/microsoft-developer-fired-after-22-years-becomes-a-goose-farmer), who got let go from Microsoft for not hitting his KPIs and changed his title to "Goose Farmer" - not because he's actually farming geese, but because his take is that we're all goose farmers who just haven't missed our KPIs yet.

## What's Next

This blog used to run on Jekyll, but installing Ruby in 2026 felt wrong, so the whole thing now runs on bun. The migration - build script, Cloudflare Workers deploy, even this post - was done with Claude using only audio prompts. No typing, just talking through what I wanted, which felt like the right way to revive a mass grave of abandoned side projects.

More posts coming.
