> People write because no one listens.

My last post before this month was in 2014. I never stopped having opinions, but the overhead of publishing here was its own thing. Maintaining a blog, formatting, deploying, sitting in front of a screen willing coherent paragraphs into existence. The effort wasn't worth it.

What changed is that writing became enjoyable again. AI didn't replace the thinking - it removed everything around it. The infrastructure disappeared, so all that's left is the part that actually matters: figuring out what you want to say. When publishing costs nothing, more of us get to be seen?
