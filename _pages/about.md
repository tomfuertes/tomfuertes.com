Fractional CTO. Former poker player turned front-end developer turned technical leader.

I run [NoTambourine](https://notambourine.com), where I provide fractional CTO services to growth-stage companies. Past clients include Uber, DoorDash, Casper, Patagonia, Adidas, Ring, and Zendesk.

Before that: conversion rate optimization, A/B testing infrastructure, and the messy middle where product meets engineering.
